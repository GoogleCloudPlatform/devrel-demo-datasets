# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept suggestions and corrections to scripts. There are just a few small guidelines and conditions you need to follow.
We can also accept pictures of your pets and entries into the `pets` table as long as:
- You understand that by submitting your work (e.g., via a pull request), you are dedicating your contributions to the public domain under the project's chosen license.
- There is no Personally Identifiable Information in the media you submit (e.g., clear metadata and make sure no people are visible in the media)

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

The project team will try to review all contributions and consider them for merging.
However, contributions will be reviewed pending on maintainer time and not all pull requests will be reviewed or incorporated.

## Community Guidelines

This project follows [Google's Open Source Community
Guidelines](https://opensource.google/conduct/).
